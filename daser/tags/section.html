           Armenia (/ɑːrˈmiːniə/ (listen)),[13][a] officially the Republic of Armenia,[b] is a
           landlocked country in the Armenian Highlands of 
Western Asia.[14] It is a part of the
           Caucasus region; and is bordered by Turkey to the 
west, Georgia to the north, the Lachin
            corridor (under a Russian peacekeeping force)[15] 
and Azerbaijan to the east, and Iran and
            the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan to the 
south.[16] Yerevan is the capital, largest city
            and the financial center.

           Armenia is a unitary, multi-party, democratic nation-
state with an ancient cultural heritage.
           The first Armenian state of Urartu was established in 
860 BC, and by the 6th century BC it was r
           eplaced by the Satrapy of Armenia. The Kingdom of 
Armenia reached its height under Tigranes the
           Great in the 1st century BC and in the year 301 
became the first state in the world to adopt
           Christianity as its official 
religion.[17][18][19][20] The ancient Armenian kingdom was split
            between the Byzantine and Sasanian Empires around 
the early 5th century. Under the Bagratuni
            dynasty, the Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia was 
restored in the 9th century. Declining due
            to the wars against the Byzantines, the kingdom fell 
in 1045 and Armenia was soon after
            invaded by the Seljuk Turks. An Armenian 
principality and later a kingdom Cilician Armenia
            was located on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea 
between the 11th and 14th centuries.
          
           Between the 16th and 19th centuries, the traditional 
Armenian homeland composed of Eastern
           Armenia and Western Armenia came under the rule of 
the Ottoman and Persian empires, repeatedly
           ruled by either of the two over the centuries. By the 
19th century, Eastern Armenia had been
           conquered by the Russian Empire, while most of the 
western parts of the traditional Armenian
           homeland remained under Ottoman rule. During World 
War I, 1.5 million Armenians living in their
           ancestral lands in the Ottoman Empire were 
systematically exterminated in the Armenian genocide.
           In 1918, following the Russian Revolution, all non-
Russian countries declared their independence
           after the Russian Empire ceased to exist, leading to 
the establishment of the First Republic of
           Armenia. By 1920, the state was incorporated into the 
Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet
           Republic, and in 1922 became a founding member of the 
Soviet Union. In 1936, the Transcaucasian state was dissolved,
           transforming its constituent states, including the 
Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic, into ful
           l Union republics. The modern Republic of Armenia 
became independent in 1991 during the dissolution
            of the Soviet Union.
          
           Armenia is a developing country and ranks 85th on the 
Human Development Index (2021).[21] Its economy
           is primarily based on industrial output and mineral 
extraction. While Armenia is geographically located
            in the South Caucasus, it is generally considered 
geopolitically European. Since Armenia aligns itself
            in many respects geopolitically with Europe, the 
country is a member of numerous European organizations
            including the Council of Europe, the Eastern 
Partnership, Eurocontrol, the Assembly of European Regions,
            and the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development. Armenia is also a member of certain regional groups
             throughout Eurasia, including the Asian Development 
Bank, the Collective Security Treaty Organization, the
              Eurasian Union, and the Eurasian Development Bank. 
Armenia supports the de facto independent Artsakh, which was 
proclaimed in 1991. Armenia also recognises the Armenian 
Apostolic Church, the world's oldest national church, as the 
country's primary religious establishment.[4][22] The unique 
Armenian alphabet was created by Mesrop Mashtots in 405 AD.
